## 🚀 Coming Soon
We are currently in the **Technical Research & Base Architecture** phase. ASAP is being built from the ground up using **PySide6** with a React-inspired component architecture.

### Key Features Under Development:
- [x] **Multi-threaded Engine:** Segmented downloading for maximum speed.
- [ ] **Social Media Extraction:** One-click downloads for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and more (via `yt-dlp`).
- [ ] **Browser Integration:** Native messaging bridge for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
- [ ] **Responsive UI:** Dark/Light mode support with fluid micro-animations.
- [ ] **Africa-Optimized:** Smart scheduling for "Night Owl" data bundles and low-power modes.
